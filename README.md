# CoCreate

[My Notes](notes.md)

CoCreate is a collaborative drawing application, that allows multiple users to create and interact on a shared digital canvas at the same time. Updates to the canvas are shown in real-time using WebSockets to broadcast user's edits to each other. 


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Single page layout that serves as a foundation for the entire application. It will include the main canvas and the user interface elements for drawing tools and session management. Planning on using one main container of HTML 1- home page 2- login page 3- dashboard/ my canvases page 4- canvas drawing page

- **CSS** - Styling of the main layout, the drawing canvas, and all the interactive tools. Dedicated CSS file for each component to present each page in a user-friendly, clean way. 

- **React** - React Router library will handle the routing for navigation between pages. Using components to represent different parts of the user interface and routing to navigate between them. A component for each part of the application will be created (main app router, home page, login page, drawing board, tools, users in session)

- **Service** - Backend server for:
    - User login/registration/authentication 
    - Retreiving drawing sessions user has access to
    - Creating/managing drawing sessions
    - API to retreive a color palette
    - image search API for importing images to canvas
    - font selsection API

- **Database/Login** - SQL database for storing user authentication details/credentials, managing drawing board sessions, storing the drawing history of sessions

- **WebSocket** - Handling of client connections between the server and other clients with a constand open connection. Makes it so any edits a user makes to the session will be shown on the page on other users interface.
