# CoCreate

[My Notes](notes.md)

CoCreate is a collaborative drawing application, that allows multiple users to create and interact on a shared digital canvas at the same time. Updates to the canvas are shown in real-time using WebSockets to broadcast user's edits to each other. 


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Ever wish you could sketch out ideas with a friend as if you were sitting right next to them, even though you are on the other side of the world? CoCreate is the answer!

- Ability to upload images to the canvas

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Single page layout that serves as a foundation for the entire application. It will include the main canvas and the user interface elements for drawing tools and session management. Planning on using one main container of HTML 1- home page 2- login page 3- dashboard/ my canvases page 4- canvas drawing page

- **CSS** - Styling of the main layout, the drawing canvas, and all the interactive tools. Dedicated CSS file for each component to present each page in a user-friendly, clean way. 

- **React** - React Router library will handle the routing for navigation between pages. Using components to represent different parts of the user interface and routing to navigate between them. A component for each part of the application will be created (main app router, home page, login page, drawing board, tools, users in session)

- **Service** - Backend server for:
    - User login/registration/authentication 
    - Retreiving drawing sessions user has access to
    - Creating/managing drawing sessions
    - API to retreive a color palette
    - image search API for importing images to canvas
    - font selsection API

- **Database/Login** - SQL database for storing user authentication details/credentials, managing drawing board sessions, storing the drawing history of sessions

- **WebSocket** - Handling of client connections between the server and other clients with a constand open connection. Makes it so any edits a user makes to the session will be shown on the page on other users interface. 



## ðŸš€ AWS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Server deployed and accessible with custom domain name** - [My server link](https://startup.emmastartup.com).
- [x] Set up my AWS account
- [x] Created a new EC2 instance, and could access the server using http://100.28.64.219
- [x] Leased a domain in Route53
    - My domain name I created is emmastartup.com
- [x] Edited my Caddyfile so that I could access my server through HTTPS.
    - At this point, I was able to securely establish a connection with my domain that I leased since I had secured the connection. 

Issues I ran into:

I could not access my server using http://startup.emmastartup.com due to my computer browser firewalls not letting me establish a connection because the server hadn't been secured yet. However that was quickly resolved once I updated the Caddyfile and established the HTTPS connection.

## ðŸš€ HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.


- [x] **HTML pages** - Used the Go Live feature on VS code to render the HTML I wrote for each page. First I worked on the "Home" page that is presented to logged in users. Next I created the HTML for the "login" page that lets existing users log into their accoutn and new users to create an accoutn. Both of the log in buttons successfully link to the index html page. 

- [x] **Proper HTML element usage** - Created a footer that contains my name and link to my GitHub that will be on all pages. I used input elements to create username and password input sections. Used "required" attribute on both the username and password. 

- [x] **Links** - the "Log In" and "Create Accout" buttons both link to the home page (index.html), all the links work for surfing between pages. 

Linked the canvases on the dashboard to the canvas.html file. Also included a "delete" button element for each canvas but planning on making it into an x button with CSS and JS for the functionality 

Home Page button links to index.html

- [x] **Text** - Included text descriptions of the buttons and image on my html. The layout is not what I want it to be but hopefully I will fix it with CSS.

- [x] **3rd party API placeholder** - I just used a simple canvas elemetn in HTML to represent what I will be able to import an API for in order to implement the actual functionality of the drawing board

- [x] **Images** - I used some plceholder images for the icons of the canavases but will be replaced with the users actual drawing boards. 

- [x] **Login placeholder** - Created a "welcome user" on the home page of the screen. I made some login input elements but they have no functionality yet

- [x] **DB data placeholder** - User information, as well as the saved canvas boards will eb stored in my database but for now are just represented by images and text. 

- [x] **WebSocket placeholder** - The plan is to have updates of active users and edits in real time with the web socket implementation but for now is represented by a canvas element and a div elemetn containing text

## ðŸš€ CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Header, footer, and main content body** - Designed using Bootstrap. Completed on home page, dashboard page, canvas page, login page
- [x] **Navigation elements** - Home page buttons navigate to the dashboard or the login page. Dashboard page buttons and project icons navigate to the home page and canvas page. Login page routes to the home page. All navigation elements work
- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - Completed on home page, dashboard page, canvas page, login page. Used flex box to help with this
- [x] **Application elements** - I used very minor amoutns of JS to show some of the interactivity of elements on the canvas page. Styled buttons and forms to how I wanted them to look. I made a side bar on the canvas page that pops up from the side of the screen when the icon at the top of the page is clicked and will go away once the icon is clicked again. I also restyled the default appearance of some of the elements like the color selector and the size adjustor bar. 
- [x] **Application text content** - set a standard font for the whole application, correctly aligned and centered text where I wanted them to be placed
- [x] **Application images** - Used Bootstrap's icon library to make some of the selections into symbols rather than just a button
